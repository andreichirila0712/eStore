This was the second project made back in the 2nd year, some of the files are not made by me, not even the idea. We were given the headers and had to do all the implementation work except for the JSON, "FinalQuestionsHelper.cpp", "JSONSerializer.cpp", "TestHelper", "main" and ObjectFactory which were already implemented by the teacher (and assistants).



This implementation is not fully functional, 2 tests out of 14 are not passed yet. I will come with an update soon.
